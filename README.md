# Hybrid Car

Hybrid cars usually have higher initial costs but lower fuel costs than non-hybrid cars. To help a car buyer decide which car has overall lower costs, this console program computes the cost of owning a car for 5 years. A user runs the program for two potential car purchases in order to compare the resulting costs.
